🌍 Travel Itinerary Planner (Using Linked List)

🧭 Overview

Travel Itinerary Planner is a small, interactive web project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing the practical use of the Linked List data structure.
The project allows users to plan and manage their travel itineraries by adding stops, exploring destinations, and navigating through their journey in a sequential manner — similar to how nodes are connected in a linked list.


This project is an excellent example of how fundamental Data Structures can be applied to real-world scenarios like travel route planning and itinerary management.


✨ Features


🗺️ Add, View & Navigate Stops – Add travel stops dynamically and view your next destination.


🔗 Linked List Implementation – Each travel stop is treated as a node connected to the next one.


📍 Next Stop Traversal – Navigate through stops just like traversing a linked list.


💻 Simple & Responsive Interface – Clean layout for smooth user experience.


🧰 Multiple Pages – Includes pages for adding stops, viewing destinations, and accessing tools.

HTML5	Structure of the web pages
CSS3	Styling and design
JavaScript (Vanilla)	Logic, event handling, and linked list operations
Linked List (DSA)	Used to store and traverse travel stops


💡 Linked List Concept in the Project

This project uses a Linked List to manage the travel stops in an itinerary.
Each stop is represented as a node, containing:

The name of the stop

A pointer/reference to the next stop

The app performs these basic operations:

Add Node: Add a new travel stop (creates a new node)

Traverse List: Move to the next stop in sequence

Display Data: View current and upcoming destinations

This simple use of a linked list helps visualize how sequential data can be managed efficiently in real-life applications.
